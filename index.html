My research examines how credentialing regimes, fiscal architectures, and governance reforms reorganize professional legitimacy and labor stratification in early childhood education. I analyze California’s Universal Transitional Kindergarten and PK–3 credential reforms as policy sites where institutional definitions of “qualification” redistribute recognition, authority, and workforce access.
</p>

<p>
Grounded in Critical Feminist Theory, Intersectionality, and Community Cultural Wealth, I employ critical phenomenology and cross-role qualitative inquiry to examine how educators, faculty, and district leaders interpret reform implementation. My work interrogates how equity-framed expansions can reproduce stratification through credential alignment, funding flows, and administrative control.
</p>

<p>
As a practicing early childhood educator, I situate policy analysis within lived institutional contexts, linking qualitative inquiry to institutional design and workforce equity debates.
